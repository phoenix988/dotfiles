** ABOUT MY DOTFILES
[[file:./.images/hyprland-desktop.png]]
This repo is for all my personal config files for Software I use daily.
Alot of my configs are based of other peoples configs to make it easy for me.
I just tweak them to my liking. For example my qtile config I based off Distro Tubes
Qtile config and tweaked some keybindings I didn't like and styled it a little bit


** CONFIGS
*** WINDOW MANAGERS
All the Window Manager configs I have
But the only Two I have played around with and kept up to date
is hyprland and qtile the other configs might be a bit out of date
since I have used them. So if you pull down my xmonad,awesome and specrteWM
config they might be broken so keep that in mind.

*** TEXT EDITORS
Well the only text editor I use is Doom emacs and Neovim
Doom emacs is great cause it has a ton of features. But the vim
motions completly changed the way I use my computer it's fantastic.
So I store the configs of my favorite text editor here in my dotfiles

** SCRIPTS
I also store some of my custom scripts here that I used
to make my life a little bit easier
**** SYNC SCRIPT
This is a script that I use to quickly sync some
of my most popular scripts and configs to my repos.
So everytime. I modify a config locally on my pc then
when this script run it will sync it.
|---------------+-------------------------------|
| [[.scripts/sync]] | [[.scripts/sync/sync-script.org]] |
|---------------+-------------------------------|
**** TMUX SESSION
Script for tmux that will create a session if it doesnt exist already.
If it does exist this script will attach that session. Use it to Quickly
Create some tmux windows.
|---------------------+-------------------------------------------|
| [[.scripts/activated/]] | [[.scripts/activated/create-tmux-session.sh]] |
|---------------------+-------------------------------------------|
**** TMUX JUMP
Some simple tmux script I wrote so I can create a keybinding in my windowmanager
to quickly jump between tabs within a tmux session.
|---------------+---------------------------|
| [[.scripts/tmux]] | [[.scripts/tmux/window-(1-9)]] |
|---------------+---------------------------|
**** OTHERS
Also has some other scripts to set random wallpapers, control volume so I can bind
it to my window manager easily as a keybinding.
