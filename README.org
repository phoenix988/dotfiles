*** About My Dotfiles
This repo is for all my personal config files for Software I use daily
Alot of my configs are based of other peoples configs to make it easy for me.
I just tweak them to my liking. For example my qtile config I based off Distro Tubes
Qtile config and tweaked some keybindings I didn't like and styled it a little bit
