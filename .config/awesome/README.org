* ABOUT THE CONFIG
** RC
In ~rc.lua~ I define some rules some variables etc but overall I try to keep it minimal

** WIDGETS
under the folder ~widgets~ I define my widgets that I display in my wibar. In order to add them to the wibar you need to modify
~wibar_default.lua~ under the folder ~wibar~ and there will be two setups there, one is made for the main screen and the second one will
be activated on the second screen or third screen depending on how many that you have.

** BINDINGS
under ~bindings.lua~ you define all the custom keybindings

** THEMES
under the ~themes~ folder you define all the colors to be used inside the wibar. and you define custom themes here too if you want.
if you want to change the current theme you need to modify ~activate_theme.lua~ the name of the theme will be the same name as the theme folder
and the lua file needs to be named ~theme.lua~ and you put all the colors inside a theme table, it will be easier if you just copy one of the made themes
and just change the colors.
