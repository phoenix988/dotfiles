** Line Numbers
Settings for line numbers change relative to example absolute if you want
to see the exact line number of the file. But I always prefer relative

** Shell
Settings for the various shells inside of emacs

** Themes
Here you can set your prefered theme, I load my themes with the package doom-themes
So I have various themes to choose from. If you want to change theme change the variable
Load-theme to the prefered them you can also do 'SPC h' + t to change theme on the fly
But to make it permanent you need to modify config.el

(use-package doom-themes
  :config
  (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t
        doom-themes-enable-italic t)

  (doom-themes-treemacs-config)

  (doom-themes-org-config))
